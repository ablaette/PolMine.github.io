At the CLARIN Annual Conference 2015 (Wroclaw, September 15-18 2015), I gave an invited talk
on "Interaction and dialogue with large-scale textual data: Parliamentary speeches of migrants
and speeches about migration". Corpus analysis entails going back and forth between quantitative
and qualitative approaches to develop interpretations. One of the tools I used for supporting my
argument was a three-dimensional visualisation of cooccurrence graphs of speeches on migration
and integration affairs of speakers in the German Bundestag. The cooccurrence graphs are now available
online, as a "normal version", and a "anaglyph version" (get red-cyan goggles for the anaglyph effect).
Use controls to zoom in/out and to rotate the graphs.
