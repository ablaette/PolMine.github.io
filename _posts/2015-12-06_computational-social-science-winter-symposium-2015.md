At the 2nd GESIS Computational Social Science Winter Symposium 2015 (Cologne, December 2nd/3rd),
we presented the R-package polmineR with a Posterposter_css_preview. The package is designed to make
working with large, linguistically annotated multi-purpose corpora fast and efficient. It is available at GitHub.
Please note: There are some significant changes happening on the development branch. Most importantly,
I am moving from data.frames to data.tables. Some changes will make it much easier to offer a documentation
that can be digested. Please watch out for v0.6.0 of polmineR that is scheduled to be available in February.
